        <h2>About</h2><hr/>
        <p>UndocuBonds was created by a group of immigrant youth at Undocuhackathon to provide financial resources to undocumented immigrants. We believe no one should be separated from their families due to lack of money and legal resources.<br/><br/>
        UndocuBonds provides resources on bail bonds, strategies, knowledge and financial support. We encourage you to use our resources to your advantage!</p>
